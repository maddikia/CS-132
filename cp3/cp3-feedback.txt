1. What have you learned and applied in CP 3 since CP 2?

I learned a lot about working with APIs, and got to brush up on using them
in combination with the other skills we've been building this term. I looked
through a lot of different APIs and, while I ended up using a pretty simple one,
I feel like I learned a lot about how to work with them in general.

2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 3 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of HTML/CSS/JS/UI)?

I'm turning these in pretty late, so I don't really mind what kind of feedback 
you choose to give me. I'm always open to any feedback you have, though, it 
just doesn't necessarily have to be super thorough.

3. Anything else you would like the grader to know?

Not reallyâ€”-my project for this one is pretty simple.
