1. What have you learned and applied in CP 2 since CP 1?

I learned about how to integrate JavaScript into my sites! I'd done this in the 
past, but I never formally learned and, and it was a really good refresher and 
taught be better code style as well. 

2. To what extent would you like feedback in CP 2 (e.g. thorough, particular areas of HTML/CSS/JS/UI)?

Whatever extent you want. I'm kind of rushing my assignments right now becauseI was
sick for like half the term and spent a lot of time on Ditch Day, so I'm 
not really going to be able to make any more changes to this during the class.

That said, I'm happy to hear any feedback to have, since I do plan to make 
more sites in the future and there's a lot of things I wanted to do in this 
class that I didn't get to.

3. Anything else you would like the grader to know?

Not really, see above.
